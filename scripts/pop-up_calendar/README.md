# [`pop-up_calendar.ahk`](./pop-up_calendar.ahk)

**Shows a pop-up calendar when pressing <kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>.**

Who enjoys moving their cursor
to the bottom right corner of the screen
and clicking on the taskbar clock
to see a calendar that doesn't even have week numbers?
Me neither.

This pop-up calendar is just a keypress (or two) away.
And it has week numbers!
The current time is shown in the title bar.

Uses the locale specified in
_Windows Settings &rarr; Time & Language &rarr; Region &rarr; Regional format_.

## Moving around the calendar with the keyboard

When the calendar window is focused,
you can:

- use the arrow keys to move between days.
- press <kbd>Esc</kbd> to close the calendar.
- press <kbd>Home</kbd> / <kbd>End</kbd>
  to move to the first/last day
  of the currently selected month.
- press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + arrow keys / <kbd>Home</kbd> / <kbd>End</kbd>
  to move around in bigger leaps.
- press <kbd>Menu</kbd> (or <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>F10</kbd>)
  and then <kbd>G</kbd> ("*G*o to today")
  to focus today.

## Note about Windows Cortana

<kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> opens Cortana by default,
so you might want to modify the pop-up calendar's keyboard shortcut
if you want to also use Cortana.

Personally,
I don't often open Cortana,
but when I do,
I do it accidentally.
