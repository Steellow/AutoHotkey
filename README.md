  instead of quitting it
  when pressing <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F4</kbd>.

  E.g. `;copy` &rarr; Â©.

## Installation instructions

1. Download and install [AutoHotkey v2](https://www.autohotkey.com/v2/).
   - The scripts are developed for v2.0-beta.1.
     Newer versions might also work
     since the scripts are very simple.
   - Currently there's no installer for v2, only a zip file.
     Extract the zip file e.g. to `%programfiles%/AutoHotkey_2.0-beta.1/`.
2. Download the scripts that fancy you
   or clone the whole repo:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mtsknn/AutoHotkey.git
   ```
3. Run the scripts that fancy you by opening them.
   - When opening an `.ahk` file for the first time,
     Windows should ask you
     what program to use to open the file.
     Select "Always use this app to open .ahk files"
     and choose `AutoHotkey64.exe`
     from AutoHotkey's installation folder.
   - If Windows doesn't ask you,
     or if you later want to change the default program to open `.ahk` files:
     1. Right click on an `.ahk` file and select "Properties."
     2. Change the program in the "Opens with" section.

Bonus points if you modify the scripts to your liking!

### Running scripts automatically when logging in to Windows

Create shortcuts for the scripts
and place the shortcuts to `%appdata%/Microsoft/Windows/Start Menu/Programs/Startup`.

- To open the `Startup` folder:
  1. Open the Run dialog by pressing <kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>.
  2. Paste the above path to the Run window.
  3. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
- To create a shortcut:
  - Drag and drop an `.ahk` file to the `Startup` folder
    while holding <kbd>Alt</kbd>.
  - Or right click on an `.ahk` file and select "Create shortcut,"
    and then move the shortcut to the `Startup` folder.

## Remarks

### `#SingleInstance` directive

The [`#SingleInstance` directive](https://lexikos.github.io/v2/docs/commands/_SingleInstance.htm)
is used in every script.
It allows only a single instance of a script to be running,
so that running a script that is already running
makes the new instance replace the old instance automatically.

### Why AutoHotkey v2 instead of v1

Because it's so much better.
More details coming some day.
